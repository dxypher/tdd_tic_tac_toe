This is a Tic Tac Toe game written in Ruby using TDD.

The game decides randomly who goes first, the computer or the human player.

The first player is always 'X', and the second player is always 'O'.

To make your move type a number between 1-9 representing the box you want to place a mark in.

The objective was to create a game where the computer would not lose.
